Date Night NYC 
-------

Date Night NYC is a web application that generates dates ideas for busy New Yorkers. Unlike HowAboutWe, Date Night NYC streamlines the planning process and requires minimal input from users. With one click of a button, users are provided with three dinner and two event options based on the user's location. 

Date Night NYC was created by [Tejal Patel][tp] and [Brenda Dargan-Levy][bd] as part of General Assembly's August 2014 Web Development Immersive.
